# Signal-processing-and-Fourier-tranforms
This project explores how we can create spectrograms to identify different components of a signal and how to create filters in frequency space that help us to isolate different parts of a signal.


We further look into how we can use Fast Fourier Transforms and Inverse FFTs for signal processing.
